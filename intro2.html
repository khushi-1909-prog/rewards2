    <p>
      <strong>Better Buy</strong> Better Buy now wants to expand its offerings by introducing two new services on alongside its existing shopping features. The platform now offers a rewards program section along with a video shopping service. Through the rewards program, consumers will be able to earn reward points after every successful purchase and redeem these points for cash discounts or to purchase new products. Alongside this, the video shopping service allows consumers to watch short product videos that demonstrate product features, usage, and available options, helping them better understand products before making a purchase and order directly through video.
